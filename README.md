# Stylizing 3D Gaussian Splatting Rendering
Anurag Parcha<br>

This work is build on top of the "3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering" work by Bernhard Kerbl, Georgios Kopanas, Thomas Leimk√ºhler and George Drettakis. The repository to their work is: https://github.com/An-u-rag/stylized-gaussian-splatting. You can also find their paper here: https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/3d_gaussian_splatting_high.pdf.
